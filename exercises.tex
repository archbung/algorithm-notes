6. Circulation problem
G = (V, E)
$c: E -> R^+$
$b: V -> R$

The circulation problem is 

$b(S) = flow (V\S, S) - flow(S, V\S)$

Make arbitrary partition of V as (S, V\S).  Then we have that 
flow(S, V\S) = b(S) <= c(S,V\S)

necessity
Make arbitrary partition of V as (S, V\S), and set b(S) > 0 (we can always do this).
Then essentially c(S,V\S) is min cut


7. Rounding things
How to arrive at consistent rounding in the presence of addition?
A

M_i = \floor \sum A_ij - \sum \floor A_ij

Create a flow with s, bunch or vertices corresponding with rows of A, bunch of
vertices corresponding with columns of A, and t.

Every edge from s to $r_i$ should have capacity from $M_i$, $M_i + 1$, because
we could round up or round down.  And accordingly for edges from $c_i$ to t.
Then create a back edge from t to s, and we have ourselves a circulation
problem.  Now assign all demands to be 0.
